<h1>The iPhone 4 is Apple's fourth smartphone. It was manufactured by Foxconn and Pegatron. It was released on June 24, 2010/ February 10,2011/ April 28, 2011 and discontinued on September 10, 2013. Its model names were A1332 (GSM model) and A1349 (CDMA model). The pricing started at $199 for the 16GB and $299 for the 32GB. The iPhone 4 received a lot of positive feedback with over 600,000 pre orders in 24 hours. The iPhone 4 remained as the most selling iPhone model for fifteen months, being beat by the 4S. The iPhone 4 could live up to 4 years if taken care of. The iPhone 4 had 3 different leaks causing massive drama. These leaks all leaked images of the hardware and pictures of the iPhone 4 during its prototype. First it was the Engadget leak which leaked images of the iPhone 4 models. Then it was the Gizmodo leak. A gadget website named Gizmodo bought an iPhone 4 (pre-released) and did surgery on it and were called to return the iPhone. Lastly, the Taoviet leak, pictures and videos of the iPhone were leaked on a Taoviet, a Vietnamese website on May 12, 2010. The website leaked the final product unlike the other two leaks. The iPhone 4 became available for pre-order on June 15, 2010, for the tech market causing online websites to crash due to the surge in traffic. The iPhone 4 used the same display length as the 2G and the 3G, 3.5 in (89 mm) diagonal 3:2 aspect ratio widescreen. </h1>
